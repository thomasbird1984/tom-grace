#### What to say
There are over 7 billion people in this world, that being said, not one, none could ever mean what you mean to me. No one could ever make me feel the way you do, a feeling I knew from day one. I'm not gonna lie I'm not totally sure how I know but I do.

It could that I couldn't imagine spending another day without you. Maybe its because I want to wake up to your beautiful smile every morning and every night. It could be that I know I'm a better person because of you. It could be your intelligence, your kindness, your love, your beauty that is unsurpassed by any other. It could be a million reasons that I could think of right now!

Very early in our relationship I told you "This could be your last first date"! I'm hoping today you'll make me the happiest man alive by making that statement true. Grace Mary Choi, I want to make you the happiest girl alive, I want to be there for you during the best and the worst, I want to share challenges everyday with you overcoming them together and growing closer with each one. I don't want to just "hold your hand I want to hold your heart!" because you are the only one to me, for now and forever!

Will you marry me?!?!?!?!
